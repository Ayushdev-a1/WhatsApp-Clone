📹 Real-Time Video & Voice Calling
Leverages **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer video and voice communication. Features include:
- Multi-user support for group calls.
- Low-latency streaming with adaptive bitrate.
- Noise suppression and echo cancellation for clear audio.



🔒 End-to-End Encrypted Messaging
All messages are encrypted using **AES-256** with secure key exchange via Diffie-Hellman. Only intended recipients can decrypt and view content, ensuring privacy.



👥 Multi-User Support
Handle multiple users in group chats or calls with real-time updates powered by **Socket.IO**. Scalable backend ensures smooth performance even with high concurrency.



🧪 Test It Out

Register multiple user accounts to test group functionality.
Initiate a video or voice call and verify real-time performance.
Send encrypted messages and confirm only participants can view them.
Test responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Run automated tests:
npm test
